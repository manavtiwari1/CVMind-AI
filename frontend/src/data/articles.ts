    intro: `<p>Two candidates apply for the same data analyst role. Both know SQL, both have three years of experience, both built dashboards. One gets shortlisted; the other never hears back.</p>
<p>The difference is often a handful of words. Applicant Tracking Systems rank resumes by how closely they match the job description — and recruiters run keyword searches inside those systems too. If the posting says "data visualization" and your resume says "made charts," the software scores you lower, and the recruiter's search never surfaces you at all.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hard skills and tools</strong> — SQL, Figma, AutoCAD, Google Ads, Python, Salesforce</li>
<li><strong>Job titles and functions</strong> — Product Manager, Financial Analyst, DevOps Engineer</li>
<li><strong>Qualifications</strong> — B.Tech, CPA, PMP, AWS Certified, MBA</li>
<li><strong>Methods and domain terms</strong> — Agile, A/B testing, cold outreach, GAAP, supply chain</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft skills ("team player," "hard-working") are rarely useful as keywords. Recruiters don't search for them, and every resume claims them. Show soft skills through results instead: "led a 6-person team" beats "leadership skills."</p>`,

<li>Everything in the <strong>"Requirements"</strong> or <strong>"Must have"</strong> section</li>
<li>The <strong>exact job title</strong> — it's usually the heaviest-weighted keyword of all</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Compare 3–5 similar postings</h3>
<p>Open a few postings for the same role at different companies. The keywords that appear in all of them are the core vocabulary of that role — those belong in your master resume permanently.</p>
<h3>3. Check LinkedIn profiles in that role</h3>
<p>Look at the Skills sections of people who already hold the job you want. Recurring terms there tend to match what recruiters search.</p>

<li><strong>Keyword stuffing.</strong> Cramming terms unnaturally ("Excel Excel dashboards Excel reporting") reads as spam to recruiters and increasingly gets flagged by the software itself.</li>
<li><strong>White-text keywords.</strong> Hiding keywords in invisible text is the oldest trick in the book — and parsing converts everything to plain text, so recruiters see your hidden block instantly. It's an automatic credibility killer.</li>
<li><strong>Listing skills you don't have.</strong> You might pass the scan, but the first interview question exposes it. Only optimize for what's true.</li>
<li><strong>One generic resume for every job.</strong> Keyword matching is per-posting. A master resume plus 10 minutes of tailoring per application beats a "perfect" static resume every time. <a href="/tailor">CV Mind's Resume Tailorer</a> does this automatically — paste the job description and it matches the keywords for you.</li>

      { q: 'How do recruiters actually find candidates on LinkedIn?', a: 'Through keyword search with filters — titles, skills, location, and Open to Work status. Your headline, Skills section, and About section carry the most weight in whether you appear.' },
      { q: 'What is the best LinkedIn headline format?', a: 'Role | Top 2–3 skills | Proof or focus. Example: "Data Analyst | SQL, Power BI, Python | Turned churn data into a 12% retention lift." Skills in the headline rank heavily in search.' },
      { q: 'Should I use "Open to Work" if I\'m employed?', a: 'Yes — set it to "Recruiters only," which hides the signal from recruiters at your own company. The public green ring is best for freshers and openly searching candidates.' },
      { q: 'Does LinkedIn activity really matter for job search?', a: 'Moderately, and it compounds: commenting and posting keeps your face in feeds, which drives profile views, which drives recruiter messages. Two comments a week is enough to start.' },
      { q: 'Should my LinkedIn match my resume exactly?', a: 'In substance, yes — same roles, dates, and headline achievements. LinkedIn can carry more detail and personality, but contradictions between the two are a red flag recruiters check for.' },
      { q: 'How long does LinkedIn optimization take to show results?', a: 'Search visibility improves within days of updating headline and skills. Recruiter messages typically follow within 2–6 weeks, depending on how in-demand your role and location are.' },
